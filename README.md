## Introduction

The restaurant industry in Gurugram is highly competitive. To help new restaurant owners make data-driven decisions, we analyzed a comprehensive Zomato dataset to identify key trends and the most promising locations for opening new restaurants.

## Dataset

We utilized the Zomato dataset, which includes information about various restaurants such as their locations, cuisines, average costs, ratings, and more. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and included the following key columns:

- Restaurant Name
- Location
- Cuisines
- Average Cost for Two
- Currency
- Has Table booking
- Has Online delivery
- Aggregate rating
- Votes

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

1. To perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and insights.
3. To develop machine learning models to predict restaurant success factors.
4. To create a dashboard for visualizing the analysis results and providing actionable insights.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
   - Handled missing values by using appropriate imputation methods.
   - Standardized the format of categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Created new features such as price range categories, popularity index, and cuisine diversity score.

3. **Data Transformation:** 
   - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Normalized numerical variables to ensure consistency in scale.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, we explored various aspects of the dataset:

- **Location Analysis:** Identified areas in Gurugram with the highest concentration of restaurants and customer reviews.
- **Cuisine Popularity:** Analyzed the popularity of different cuisines based on customer ratings and number of votes.
- **Cost Analysis:** Examined the distribution of average costs for two people and its correlation with restaurant ratings.
- **Rating Analysis:** Investigated the factors influencing restaurant ratings, such as cuisine type and service availability.

## Machine Learning Models

We developed machine learning models to predict restaurant success based on various factors:

1. **Regression Models:** Used to predict average cost for two and restaurant ratings.
2. **Classification Models:** Applied to classify restaurants into different rating categories.

We evaluated the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression and accuracy for classification.

## Dashboard Development

We created an interactive dashboard using Tableau/Power BI to visualize our findings:

- **Location Heatmaps:** Displayed restaurant density and customer review concentrations across Gurugram.
- **Cuisine Popularity Charts:** Showed the distribution and ratings of different cuisines.
- **Cost vs. Rating Scatter Plots:** Illustrated the relationship between average cost and ratings.
- **Predictive Insights:** Provided recommendations for the best locations to open new restaurants based on the analysis.

## Results

- Identified key locations in Gurugram with high potential for new restaurant openings.
- Found that certain cuisines and price ranges were more popular and highly rated.
- Provided actionable insights for restaurant owners to optimize their offerings and locations.

## Conclusion

Our analysis provided valuable insights into the restaurant landscape in Gurugram. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we helped stakeholders make informed decisions about where to open new restaurants and how to cater to customer preferences.
